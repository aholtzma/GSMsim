%
% MAKE_NEXT:
%           This function returns a lookuptable containing a mapping
%           between the present state and the legal next states.
%           Each row correspond to a state, and the two legal states
%           related to state n is located in NEXT(n,1) and in
%           NEXT(n,2). States are represented by their related 
%           numbers.
%
% SYNTAX:   [ NEXT ] = make_next(SYMBOLS)
%
% INPUT:    SYMBOLS: The table of symbols corresponding the the state-
%                    numbers.
%
% OUTPUT:   NEXT:    The transition table describing the legal next
%		     states asdescribed above.
%
% SUB_FUNC: None
%
% WARNINGS: None
%
% TEST(S):  The function has been verified to return the expected
%           results.
