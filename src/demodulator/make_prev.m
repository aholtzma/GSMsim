% MAKE_PREVIOUS:       
%           This function returns a lookuptable containing a mapping
%           between the present state and the legal previous states.
%           Each row correspond to a state, and the two legal states
%           related to state n is located in PREVIOUS(n,1) and in
%           previous(n,2). States are represented by their related 
%           numbers.
%
% SYNTAX:   [ PREVIOUS ] = make_previous(SYMBOLS)
%
% INPUT:    SYMBOLS: The table of symbols corresponding the the state-
%                    numbers.
%
% OUTPUT:   PREVIOUS:
%                    The transition table describing the legal previous
%		     states asdescribed above.
