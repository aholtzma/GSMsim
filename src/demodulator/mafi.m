function [Y, Rhh] = mafi(r,L,T_SEQ,OSR)
%
% MAFI:     This function performes the tasks of channel impulse
%           respons estimation, bit syncronization, matched 
%           filtering and signal sample rate downconversion.
%
% SYNTAX:   [y, Rhh] = mafi(r,Lh,T_SEQ,OSR)
%
% INPUT:    r     Complex baseband representation of the received
%                 GMSK modulated signal
% 	    Lh    The desired length of the matched filter impulse
%                 response measured in bit time durations
% 	    T_SEQ A MSK-modulated representation of the 26 bits long
%                 training sequence used in the transmitted burst, 
%                 i.e. the training sequence used in the generation of r
%           OSR   Oversampling ratio, defined as f_s/r_b.
%
% OUTPUT:   Y     Complex baseband representation of the matched 
%                 filtered and down converted received signal
%
%           Rhh   Autocorrelation of the estimated channel impulse 
%                 response. The format is a Lh+1 unit long column vector 
%                 starting with Rhh[0], and ending with Rhh[Lh]. 
%                 Complex valued.
%
% SUB_FUNC: None
%
% WARNINGS: The channel estimation is based on the 16 most central 
%           bits of the training sequence only
%
% TEST(S):  Tested manually through test script mf_ill.m
