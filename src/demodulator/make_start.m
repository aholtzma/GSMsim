% MAKE_START:
%           This code returns a statenumber corresponding to the start
%           state as it is found from Lh. The method is to use the table
%           of symbolic start states as it is listed in the report made 
%           by 95gr870T. For the table lookups are made in SYMBOLS. in 
%           order to map from the symbol representation to the state number 
%           representation.
%
% SYNTAX:   [ START ] = make_start(Lh,SYMBOLS)
%
% INPUT:    SYMBOLS: The table of symbols corresponding the the state-
%                    numbers.
%           Lh:      Length of the estimated impulseresponse.
%
% OUTPUT:   START:   The number representation of the legal start state.
%
% SUB_FUNC: None
%
% WARNINGS: The table of symbolic representations has not been verified
%           but is used directly as it is listed in the report made 
%           by 95gr870T.
%
% TEST(S):  The function has been verified to return a state number
%           which matches the symbolic representation.
